## Ingredients:

* 16 oz. defrosted frozen udon noodles or refrigerated or dried; see notes
* 2 tablespoons canola oil or other neutral tasting oil
* 1 bunch green onions sliced , 1/2 cup dark green parts reserved (6-8 total green onions)
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 8 oz. shiitake mushrooms sliced (or cremini/baby portobella, or other mushroom)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce low sodium if preferred
* 1 tablespoon fresh ginger finely grated on a microplane zester
* 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce such as Huy Fong, or Sriracha (more or less depending on spice level preference)
* 1/3 cup water or chicken or vegetable broth
* 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves and/or cilantro, optional

## Directions:

1. If using dried udon noodles, prepare according to directions on package (see notes).
1. Heat the canola oil (2 tablespoons) in a large deep skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the light green and white parts of the green onions (making sure to reserve about 1/2 cup of the darkest green parts) and the minced garlic (2 cloves). Sauté for about 2 minutes, until onions are softened and garlic is toasted and fragrant.
1. Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms (8 oz.) to the skillet and sauté until browned and softened, stirring occasionally (about 5 minutes).
1. While the mushrooms are cooking, make the sauce. In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, mix the soy sauce (1/4 cup), fresh ginger (1 tablespoon), sesame oil (2 teaspoons), rice vinegar (1 tablespoon), chili garlic sauce (2 teaspoons), honey (1 tablespoon) and water (1/3 cup).
1. Add the sauce and the prepared noodles to the skillet. Stir together. If things are sticking to the bottom, add 1/4 cup of water and use a wooden spoon to scrape anything from the bottom of the skillet.
1. Add the dark green onion slices (1/2 cup) as well as the basil/cilantro leaves (1/4 cup) if using. Stir together and serve.
