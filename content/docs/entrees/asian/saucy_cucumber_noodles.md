## Ingredients:

* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon toasted (Asian) sesame oil
* 2 teaspoons tamari or soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons Asian chili-garlic sauce or sambal oelek
* 1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 1/2 pounds English cucumbers (2 medium)
* 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds

## Directions:

1. Place the vinegar, sesame oil, tamari or soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, ginger, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
1. Trim the ends from the cucumbers, then cut in half crosswise. Using a spiralizer with the thinnest "noodle" attachment, spiralize the cucumber into long, thin strands. Use kitchen shears to cut the cucumber noodles in half, if desired.
1. Add the noodles to the bowl with the dressing and gently toss to coat. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and serve immediately.
