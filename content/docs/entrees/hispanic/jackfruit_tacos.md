## Ingredients:

### For the jackfruit:
* 2 20oz cans green jackfruit in water or brine , drained, rinsed, and chopped (see instructions)
* 1 tablespoon light oil (such as canola or vegetable)
* 1 yellow onion , sliced
* 4 cloves garlic , minced
* ½ cup vegetable broth or water
* 1 tablespoon agave
* ½ lime , juiced
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* ¼ teaspoon salt
### For the tacos:
* 8 taco shells , hard or soft (gluten-free if preferred)
* 1 avocado , sliced
* ¼ red onion , thinly sliced
* ¼ cup cilantro , roughly chopped
* lime wedges


### To chop the jackfruit:
1. For optimal texture, cut the jackfruit into thin slices from the core to the outer edge as seen in the pictures. This breaks up the tougher core as much as possible and makes for the best shredded texture. Do NOT discard the core or seeds, they are totally edible, and you are just wasting precious jackfruit!
### To make the shredded jackfruit:
1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add the onions and garlic and sauté for about 5 minutes until the onions have softened and begin to brown.
1. Add the chopped jackfruit, broth, agave, lime juice and all the spices to the pot and cover. Reduce heat and let it simmer until the jackfruit softens slightly, and about ½ of the liquid is absorbed. About 5 minutes.
1. Now take a potato masher, and smash all the jackfruit up to get that shredded texture. If you find it a bit wet, just cook a little longer. If you find it a little dry, just add a splash more vegetable broth.
### To assemble the tacos:
1. Warm the taco shells according to the package directions. When warmed, add a scoop of the jackfruit, and top with an avocado slice, a couple red onion slices, some cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice. Or you can top with whatever your favourite taco toppings are! I also love a squeeze of hot sauce.
