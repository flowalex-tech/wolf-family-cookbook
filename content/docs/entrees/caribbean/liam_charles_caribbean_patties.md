* 100g sweet potato, finely chopped into 7.5mm dice

### For the coconut and lime dipping sauce:

* 50g coconut cream
* 125g soured cream

## DIRECTIONS:

1. Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/400°F/Gas 6.
1. Make the pastry. Tip the flour into a bowl and stir in the turmeric and salt.
1. Grate the frozen butter into the bowl and lightly toss it around with a table knife to coat the butter in flour.
1. Gradually add 4–5 tablespoons of cold water, stirring until the mixture comes together to form a dough. Bring the dough together into a ball, then wrap it and chill it in the fridge while you make the filling.
1. For the jerk seasoning, mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside.
1. Make the filling. Tip the coconut into a medium bowl. Add the tomato purée, peas, sweetcorn, ginger paste, garlic paste, chilli, spring onions, carrot, sweet potato and 1 tablespoon of the jerk seasoning. Mix well together and set aside.
1. Divide the chilled pastry in half and roll one piece out on a lightly floured surface slightly larger than a 23cm circle. Using a plate or the bottom of a cake tin as guide, cut the pastry into a neat 23cm circle. Repeat with remaining pastry so that you have two circles of the same size. Reserve the trimmings.
1. Divide the filling between the pastry circles, spooning it onto one half of the pastry and leaving a 1cm border around the edge. Leave the other half clear. Brush the border with water, then fold the empty half of pastry over the filling to form a patty. Repeat for the second pastry circle and filling. Seal both patties with a fork, then place them on the lined baking sheet.
1. Roll out the trimmings and, using the template provided, cut out two sets of game-controller buttons. Paint one set with the diluted red food colouring and one set with the diluted blue food colouring.
1. Glaze the patties with the beaten egg, then stick the game-controller buttons on to each patty, using the diagram as a guide. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until crisp, golden and cooked through.
1. Meanwhile, make the coconut lime dipping sauce. Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl and serve with the patties.
