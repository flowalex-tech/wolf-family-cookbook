## Ingredients:

* 5 Dried Holy Mole Peppers Although the main ingredient in this hole mole pepper recipe should be holy mole peppers this does not mean that you can't also include others. I like adding chipotle peppers as they add a smoky flavor.
* 2 oz of dark chocolate
* 1 garlic clove mashed
* black sesame seeds
* 1/4 white onion chopped
* 1 tsp of olive oil
* 1 tsp of paprika
* 1 tsp of cayenne pepper powder
* 1 cup of chicken broth
* Some people prefer to use water instead of chicken broth since some chicken broth can be salty! Add a little at a time.

## Directions:

1. The first step in this holy mole pepper recipe is to prepare the peppers. This means, you will need to place the peppers in water if you have purchased them dry. They will need to rehydrate first. However, if the peppers are fresh, pit the peppers and remove the seeds.
1. Cut the peppers into small sections and add into the blender. Don't blend yet though as you need the rest of the ingredients.
1. Now, add the rest of the ingredients in the blender, not including the black sesame seeds as these are for decoration. Blend until the consistency is similar to a thick paste. It should be smooth and have an intense scent.
1. Although the peppers do not need to be cooked, simmering the paste does bring out the intensity of the flavors better. On a medium to high temperature, simmer the paste in a pot. Make sure to keep on stirring and watching as the paste simmers. This step should only take 5-10 minutes. Turn the stove off.
1. Serve the holy mole pepper sauce in small containers or cups. In these cups, you can add the toppings as garnish. I like to add black sesame seeds because the texture adds something extra! However, you can add anything you like including black beans, chocolate shavings, and cilantro!
1. Most of the time, when I make this holy mole pepper recipe I am left with a lot of leftovers! Since this is the case, I like to store the holy mole pepper sauce for as long as I can. Surprisingly, with refrigeration and technology, holy mole pepper sauces can last a long time!
1. That being said, you should never leave your pepper sauce outside of the fridge as it does need air tight seal protection. For even more long term use, I recommend placing the sauce into containers that you can freeze. When you freeze this sauce, all you need to do is add heat, like the stovetop, to let it simmer again.
1. You can also use this holy mole pepper recipe is smaller and larger quantities with a few changes. I like to half recipes if I do not need too much.
