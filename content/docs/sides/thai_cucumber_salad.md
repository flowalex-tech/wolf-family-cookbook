Recipe from [Andrew Zimmern](https://andrewzimmern.com/recipes/easy-thai-style-cucumber-salad/)    

## Ingredients:

* 1/2 cup plus one tablespoon white vinegar
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 2 Thai chiles, finely minced
* 1 small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 European or English cucumbers
* 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped
* Crushed roasted peanuts for garnish

## Directions:

1. Split the cucumbers lengthwise and thinly slice across them.
1. In a bowl, combine the vinegar, salt, sugar and hot pepper. Mix well together until the sugar is dissolved. Sometimes I hold my bowl over a burner on the stove to warm it. If you do, cool the dressing well.
1. Stir in the cucumbers and onions. Garnish with the nuts and cilantro leaves. Serve.
