8 oz wide egg noodles (can use penne or other shapes)
2 tbsp butter (or vegan alternative) + some to grease pan
2 tbsp flour
1/4 white onion, chopped
2 cups milk (or alternative milk)
3 eggs
1 cup cheddar, grated (or alternative cheese)
1/2 cup Parmesan, grated (or vegan or nutritional yeast)
1/2 cottage cheese (I have skipped this but it would make it creamier; add more butter and milk and flour)
Dash of Tabasco or 1-2 tsp cayenne or smoked paprika, to taste
Salt and pepper to taste
Breadcrumbs

Preheat oven to 350
Boil egg noodles until they are al dente.
Grease a glass baking dish 
Melt butter in sauce pan and add flour. Stir for a minute or so.  Add onion and milk and stir out clumps. Allow mixture to bubble for a couple of minutes while stirring. 
Take off heat. Whisk 3 eggs and graddual add several tbsp of sauce to eggs until eggs warm. Pour egg mixture into sauce pan. Don't pour eggs directly into suace or they will make it clumpy.
Add cheddar, parmesan, and cottage cheese and stir until cheddar melts. Add seasonings.
Add half the sauce, the noodles, then the rest of the sauce. Mix gently and sprinkle top with breadcrumbs.
Bake covered for half an hour; remove cover and continue baking until done to liking.
